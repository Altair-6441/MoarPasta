# MoarPasta

Hi, this is a tool that divides large groups of text into predetermined groups.

Originally made for sending copypastas to friends or chatrooms, it could be useful for sending large messages through twitter or other instant messaging services that limit the amount of characters that can be sent in one message.

simply put: wall of text goes in, predetermined groups come out
